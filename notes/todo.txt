understand existing test cases and what theyre looking for

write more test cases that do weirder shit

write any helper/debugging methods (e.g. the toString for DFA maybe)

start implementing DFAState
    - make sure the concrete class we use to implement states will work for 
    what we need it to do
    - TDD and pray.

start implementing DFA
    - make sure tests for DFA state are already working properly
    - instance variables should be initialized with OOP in mind!
    - `accepts()` seems like its gonna be where the magic happens, 
    try to keep in mind how DFAState was implemented
