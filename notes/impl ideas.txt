pdf mentions we need to implement DFA states (Q) with some class that implements java.util.Set
    - looking through all classes (on javadoc) that impl Set, 
    found that the one we should prob use is LinkedHashSet, since its the 
    only one that maintains ordering within the set, which is a requirement
    of implementing how Sigma are stored.
pdf also mentions transition function needs to be implemented with class that implements java.util.Map
    - seems like LinkedHashMap would work, not entirely sure it matters
    all that much anyway.
